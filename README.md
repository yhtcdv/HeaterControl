# HeaterControl
Eberspacher D2 Heater controller based on a Feather M0 and 2.2" TFT display

I have modiied the GFX library to be compatible with the SAMD21 so added it here.
Terible code and "hacked together" but works OK. I intend to tidy it up over the comming weeks.

I also intend to add the temperature control using the DAC in the SAMD21
